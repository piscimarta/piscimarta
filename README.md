## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Marta Piscitelli, an astroparticle physics student at the University of Tubingen.
* Currently finishing a two months scholarship at the INFN (National institute for Nuclar Physics) in Frascati, Rome. Here I worked on the tuning of the $p-\Omega$ meson exchange potential with the ALICE experiment data. (see repo:)

All my old repos are on my [old github profile](https://github.com/martapisci)
* ðŸ”­ I graduated from the Univeristy of Trento with a bachelor thesis on: (also repo here: )
* I spent the first semester of the academic year 2022-2023 at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/) where I took the great Computational physics (FYS 3150) course.
