## Hi there 👋
I'm Marta Piscitelli, an astro particle physics 🌌 master student, in the department of _Theoretical Astrophysics_ at the University of Tubingen.
* 📚 Currently writing my Master's thesis working on Numerical Relativity simulations in alternative theories of gravity, specifically scalar-Gauss-Bonnet using [GRChombo](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRChombo) and [GRFolres](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRFolres). 
### Some other research highlights:
* ⚛️ I was awarded a two months scholarship at the INFN (National institute for Nuclar Physics) in Frascati, Rome. I worked on the tuning of a $p-\Omega$ meson exchange potential with the ALICE and STAR collaborations data. The work is summarized in this [publication](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2954421), which has been submitted to Proceedings of science (PoS) and is currently under review!

### Previous projects/Education:
All my old repos are on my [old github profile](https://github.com/martapisci)
* 🔭 I graduated from the Univeristy of Trento with a bachelor thesis on _Swift observations of the AGN: IRAS 13224-3809_. 
* 🇳🇴 I spent the first semester of the academic year 2022-2023 at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/) where I took Computational physics 💻 (FYS 3150) course.
