## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Marta Piscitelli, an astroparticle physics student at the University of Tubingen.
* Currently writing my Master's thesis working on Numerical Relativity simulations in alternative theories of gravity, specifically scalar-Gauss-Bonnet using [GRChombo](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRChombo) and [GRFolres](https://github.com/GRTLCollaboration/GRFolres).
### Some other research highlights:
* I was awarded a two months scholarship at the INFN (National institute for Nuclar Physics) in Frascati, Rome. I worked on the tuning of the $p-\Omega$ meson exchange potential with the ALICE and STAR collaborations data. Soon submitting the results to PoS!

### Previous education projects:
All my old repos are on my [old github profile](https://github.com/martapisci)
* ðŸ”­ I graduated from the Univeristy of Trento with a bachelor thesis on Swift observations of the AGN: IRAS 13224-3809. 
* I spent the first semester of the academic year 2022-2023 at the [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no/english/) where I took the great Computational physics (FYS 3150) course.
